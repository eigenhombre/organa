* Look, ma, no parser!

This project records my recent experiments with publishing static
sites using Org Mode.  See https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg for my
previous attempt.

In the past I've written a few (incomplete) Org Mode parsers, but HTML
is far easier to manipulate in Clojure using Hiccup or Enlive.  The
current code relies on exporting to HTML first, parsing that, and
modifying the parse tree as needed.

* Goals

- To provide a Jekyll-like (or better) workflow (edit markup files,
  have them automatically processed into HTML),
- using Org Mode as the markup language,
- supporting all of
  - my art- and image-heavy pages and image galleries;
  - my math- and code-heavy software posts;
  - my narrative-heavy South Pole blog posts.

* Workflow
Do not use this yet.  But, for the curious, my current workflow is:

- Evaluate the =core= namespace in the REPL to create the site and
  start the file watcher.
- Make edits to Org files in the source directory =site-source-dir=
  (or add new =.org= files there).
- Convert changed/added =.org= file(s) to HTML using =\C-c e hh=,
  causing the file watcher to reprocess the site.
- If needed, to restart the site-making code, re-evaluate the
  namespace after changing Clojure code /per se/.
- To "publish," use the commented-out forms at the bottom of the
  =core= namespace for syncing to the remote Web site.

* Motivation
** Why Org Mode?

I really like writing in [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] (a text editing / outlining / To
Do-list processing / scheduling / literate programming / ... mode for
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]).  The outliner gets out of my way most of the time and lets me
move ideas around while they are being formed, and lets me hide the
portions that I'm not focusing on at any given time.  I can export to
a fairly nice looking PDF document in a few keystrokes.  I also use
the literate programming and LaTeX / math support from time to time.

** Why not /just/ Org Mode?

*I.e., why a Clojure app?*  I find the export tools available for Org
Mode are not quite powerful (or fast) enough for a large blog.  I got
pretty far trying to get the export features to suit, but not far
enough -- generation of a large site took too long, and customization
was too unweildy.  In general I much prefer developing software in
[[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] than in Emacs Lisp (though admittedly I'm less experienced
with the latter).

** Why not Jekyll?

I used Jekyll for a few years and was somewhat satisfied by it.  But
it doesn't support Org Mode, and I am simply not that fond of Ruby and
its related ecosystems.  Also I have a number of customizations
relating to handling images that I'm unlikely to easily get working
with Jekyll.
